								<h2>PSL Paving Restoration Nottingham</h2>
								<p>Our services provide solutions for virtually any block paving or tarmacadam restoration problem and in addition to making your refurbished area look good we also extend its life and resistance to damage by weather or normal wear and tear.</p>
								<h3>Block Paving</h3>
								<p>We use a proven process for refurbishing and restoring block paving.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The surface is cleaned and prepared using specialist equipment.</li>
									<li>Part of the sand is cleared from the joints to remove weed seeds and moss spores.</li>
									<li>The joints are re-sanded using sterile kiln-dried sand.</li>
									<li>Two coats of specially formulated resin seal is applied, the first coat is rolled by hand so the seal can be pressed into each joint for the maximum hardening of the sand joints. The second coat is sprayed to give the whole area an even finish thus giving the drive the best protection from further weed growth and protecting the sub base from erosion.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The images below give a step-by-step breakdown of the block paving restoration process.</p>

										<p>On completion the natural colours are enhanced and all joints are stabilised to increase strength across the whole structure. The resin finish protects against surface wear and increases the life of the paving.</p>

								</div>
								<h3>Tarmacadam</h3>
								<p>Tarmac drives and other areas can be made to look like new and stay looking good by being more resistant to fading and stains. We have specialist tools and equipment to facilitate restoration and repair in one process.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The surface is thoroughly cleaned.</li>
									<li>Damaged areas are cut and replaced with new bag tarmac.</li>
									<li>Surface stains are treated and weeds removed.</li>
									<li>A specially formulated Bitumenous Seal is applied by a pressurised spray or roller to give uniform coating.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This process restores the tarmac to its original colour and re-seals the surface to prevent moisture ingress and the resultant deterioration.</p>

								<h3>Imprinted Concrete</h3>
								<p>As with all of our processes we have a specialist solution to the problems associated with imprinted concrete to enable us to refurbish your drive and protect it for the future.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The surface is thoroughly prepared using specialist cleaning and degreasing equipment.</li>
									<li>Tyre marks, oil and grease stains are removed.</li>
									<li>Debris is removed.</li>
									<li>Damaged areas can often be repaired using state of the art repair resins.</li>
									<li>Surfaces can be tinted to meet your requirements.</li>
									<li>Badly degraded areas are treated with heavy application of High Solids Resin.</li>
									<li>A coat of a specially developed maintenance mix are applied.</li>
									<li>The surface is then finished with a Matt or Gloss finish and a low slip finish where required.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Imprinted Concrete can also be restored to a superb finish and protected for the future. Imprinted concrete restoration:</p>

								<h2>PSL Paving Cleaning Nottingham</h2>
								<p>PSL Paving offers a clean only service which means you can have your drive or patio professionally cleaned to maintain its look and keep its surface protection in top shape. Cleaning with a power washer can damage the surface of your paving and leave it susceptible to damage from water ingress and more liable to become clogged with weeds and algae bewtween the joints due to the sterilised sand being washed away.</p>
								<p>We use a specialist flat surface cleaner which does not damage the structure of the paving. <strong>We can also clean walls and other garden structures as a part of total cleaning package.</strong></p>							
								<p>The pictures below show a before and after comparison to demonstrate how effective the cleaning services can be:</p>
